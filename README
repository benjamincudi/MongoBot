Getting Started
===============

    mkvirtualenv MongoBot
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    To run bot: python medulla.py
    To run bot persistently so it will recover from crashes: python doctor.py

Advanced Usage
==============

    MongoBot is capable of running a number of web services and apis. For best
    results, run it on an nginx server via uwsgi. And by best results, I mean
    any.

    Also, the markov functionality is based on redis, so you'll have to get a 
    redis server up and running. Also, the markov stuff might be broken, it's
    pretty recent and so far just spitting out three word phrases, but that
    might be due to dearth of content.

Secret settings
===============

    You will need to create a file in the root folder called secrets.py,
    containing the following variables:

    CHANNEL = "#room_for_bot_to_join"
    USERS = ['nickname_allowed_to_use_bot1', ...]

    IMPORTANT: For the following items, if you do NOT want to use them,
    set them up in the secrets file anyway, set to empty strings.

    If you want the bot to automatically post to delicious:

    DELICIOUS_USER = ""
    DELICIOUS_PASS = ""

    To use the -weather command. Accesses http://api.wunderground.com

    WEATHER_API = "" 

    To use wordnik:

    WORDNIK_API = ""

    To use the -fml command:

    FML_API = ""

    To enable sms messaging via Twilio:

    TWILIO_SID = ""
    TWILIO_TOKEN = ""
    TWILIO_NUMBER = ""

    And there's some pending work coming for wolfram, so may as well:

    WOLFRAM_API = ""

Social Secret Settings
======================

    You will need to host a website to properly setup apis.
    MongoBot is setup with uwsgi to run ontop of a(n?) nginx server.
    You're going to have to figure that one out on your own
    for the moment.

    HTTP_USER = ""
    HTTP_PASS = ""

    The following settings should be set for google/twitter/facebook functionality.

    Note it's not necessary to recycle GOOGLE_USER in this fashion but works for simplicity.

    GOOGLE_USER = ""
    GOOGLE_PASS = ""
    
    FB_USER = GOOGLE_USER + "@gmail.com"
    FB_PASS = ""
    FB_PAGE = ""
    
    FB_MONGOBOT_APPID = ""
    FB_MONGOBOT_SECRET = ""
    
    TWIT_USER = GOOGLE_USER + "@gmail.com"
    TWIT_PASS = ""
    TWIT_PAGE = ""
    
    TWIT_CONSUMER_KEY = ""
    TWIT_CONSUMER_SECRET = ""
    TWIT_ACCESS_TOKEN = ""
    TWIT_ACCESS_SECRET = ""


    ... And of course, when you need to peruse reddit.

    REDDIT_APPID = ""
    REDDIT_SECRET = ""

New features
============

    To create a new command in an existing brainmeat category, add the
    function to the class and add the decorator @axon. To add a help entry
    for the function, add @help("Help message.")

    To create a new command category, run this from the root directory: 
    
    python newbrains.py category_name

    This will create a file called category_name.py in brainmeats, with
    a class Category_name. Loading of this class will be automated, no
    other files need to be altered.
