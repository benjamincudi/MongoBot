Getting Started
===============

    mkvirtualenv MongoBot
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    To run bot: python medulla.py
    To run bot persistently so it will recover from crashes: python doctor.py

    You'll need to install MongoDB to use most of the features relating to people


Dafuq is going on?
==================

    For best results in answering this question, check out settings.py, 
    followed by medulla.py and cortex.py. Also, learn python. 


Advanced Usage
==============

    MongoBot is capable of running a number of web services and apis. For best
    results, run an nginx server and uwsgi server/deploy.ini. And by best results, 
    I mean any. More documentation on this once I figure out how I did it the 
    first time.

    Also, the markov functionality is based on redis, so you'll have to get a 
    redis server up and running. Also, the markov stuff might be broken, it's
    pretty recent and so far just spitting out three word phrases, but that
    might be due to dearth of content.


Secret settings
===============

    You will need to create a file in the root folder called secrets.py.
    example.secrets.py has descriptions of each setting, just copy it to
    secrets.py and set away.


New features
============

    To create a new command in an existing brainmeat category, add the
    function to the class and add the decorator @axon. To add a help entry
    for the function, add @help("Help message.")

    To create a new command category, run this from the root directory: 
    
    python newbrains.py category_name

    This will create a file called category_name.py in brainmeats, with
    a class Category_name. Loading of this class will be automated, no
    other files need to be altered.

To Do
=====

    TODO: Probably make this readme better
    TODO: reddit command breaks without specified subreddit
    TODO: Clean up broca, decide what to do with it
    TODO: link holdem to db, make persistant, open up sit/in/out functionality
    TODO: finish holdem, needs testing and split pots probably don't work
    TODO: stock game: account for splits and reverse splits
    TODO: remove last of beautiful soup dependencies, if possible
    TODO: add @requires decorator, check for server, redis, mongo, have -features command to check.
          Function by function level?
