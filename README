Getting Started
===============

    mkvirtualenv MongoBot
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    To run bot: python medulla.py
    To run bot persistently so it will recover from crashes: ./lighting.sh 

    To create a new command category: python newbrains.py category_name
    This will create a file called category_name.py in brainmeats, with
    a class Category_name. Loading of this class will be automated, no
    other files need to be altered.
