Getting Started
===============

    mkvirtualenv MongoBot
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    To run bot: python medulla.py
    To run bot persistently so it will recover from crashes: ./lighting.sh 

Secret settings
===============

    You will need to create a file in the root folder called secrets.py,
    containing the following variables:

    CHANNEL = "#room_for_bot_to_join"
    USERS = ['nickname_allowed_to_use_bot1', ...]

    IMPORTANT: For the following items, if you do NOT want to use them,
    set them up in the secrets file anyway, set to empty strings.

    If you want the bot to automatically post to delicious:

    DELICIOUS_USER = "username"
    DELICIOUS_PASS = "password"

    To use the -weather command. Accesses http://api.wunderground.com

    WEATHER_API = "weather_api_key" 

    To use wordnik:

    WORDNIK_API = "wordnik_api_key"

    To use the -fml command: (pending support for this)

    FML_API = "fml_api_key"

New features
============

    To create a new command in an existing brainmeat category, add the
    function to the class and add the decorator @axon. To add a help entry
    for the function, add @help("Help message.")

    To create a new command category, run this from the root directory: 
    
    python newbrains.py category_name

    This will create a file called category_name.py in brainmeats, with
    a class Category_name. Loading of this class will be automated, no
    other files need to be altered.
