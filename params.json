{"name":"MongoBot","tagline":"IRC bot for screwing around. Named not for MongoDB, but after Mongo from Blazing Saddles.","body":"![Mongo](http://huntwelch.com/mongo-100px.png)\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n===============\r\n\r\n    mkvirtualenv MongoBot\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    \r\n    To run bot: python medulla.py\r\n    To run bot persistently so it will recover from crashes: ./lighting.sh \r\n\r\nSecret settings\r\n===============\r\n\r\n    You will need to create a file in the root folder called secrets.py,\r\n    containing the following variables:\r\n\r\n    CHANNEL = \"#room_for_bot_to_join\"\r\n    USERS = ['nickname_allowed_to_use_bot1', ...]\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT: For the following items, if you do NOT want to use them,\r\n    set them up in the secrets file anyway, set to empty strings.\r\n\r\n    If you want the bot to automatically post to delicious:\r\n\r\n    DELICIOUS_USER = \"username\"\r\n    DELICIOUS_PASS = \"password\"\r\n\r\n    To use the -weather command. Accesses http://api.wunderground.com\r\n\r\n    WEATHER_API = \"weather_api_key\" \r\n\r\n    To use wordnik:\r\n\r\n    WORDNIK_API = \"wordnik_api_key\"\r\n\r\n    To use the -fml command: (pending support for this)\r\n\r\n    FML_API = \"fml_api_key\"\r\n\r\nNew features\r\n============\r\n\r\n    To create a new command in an existing brainmeat category, add the\r\n    function to the class and add the decorator @axon. To add a help entry\r\n    for the function, add @help(\"Help message.\")\r\n\r\n    To create a new command category, run this from the root directory: \r\n    \r\n    python newbrains.py category_name\r\n\r\n    This will create a file called category_name.py in brainmeats, with\r\n    a class Category_name. Loading of this class will be automated, no\r\n    other files need to be altered.\r\n\r\nTo Do\r\n=====\r\n\r\n    TODO: link holdem to db, make persistant, open up sit/in/out functionality\r\n    TODO: finish holdem, needs testing and split pots probably don't work\r\n    TODO: fix rate limiting problems with acro\r\n    TODO: stock game: account for splits and reverse splits\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
